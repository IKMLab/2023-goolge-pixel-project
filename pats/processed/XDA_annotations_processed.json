            "text": "(Request) Font changer for Pixel 6 Pro:Hello. Since we cannot change our font in settings I'm looking for a way to change the font with magisk/lsposed. Previously I'd use font changer module or create a magisk module using zfont but I can't seem to get all the fonts to change. I'm interested in using kg feeling 22. Please any advice would be very appreciated.",

In terms of getting buying the Pixel 6 Pro, you're getting the discount which pays for the 2tb so in essence you get the 2tb storage for free. It also depends if you're on an annual upgrade cycle because could you not use the 10% discount each year for each phone so again essentially getting it for free if you were going to buy a pixel phone each year anyway. Also doesn't factor in if you're buying other Google products which also gets you discount on (if I've understood the offer correctly). I already have a 2tb lifetime subscription on pcloud so this isn't about wanting or needing the storage. It's about making the best of whatever is on offer and available to us."

If the phone is identical (not sure if there will be a special Verizon version to work on different network types) then I would suggest buying direct from Google. Here in the UK, you can get 24 months 0% interest finance directly on the Google store so you can still spread the cost without paying extra for it. If they do that in the US I think that is your best bet. Hopefully you can use the $200 to pay monthly bills so it doesn't \"go to waste\"."

                    "text": "How to root Google Pixel Watch using Magisk:Note that this rooting process was performed with a special USB-C cradle provided by the Google Team. I would not recommend flashing the device without a stable connection to the pins under the wrist strap. I might attempt to make a 3D printed enclosure that uses pogo pins. Additionally, this process will wipe the device. The USB pins are under the watch band closest to the secondary button. From left to right, the pins are voltage, data+, data-, and ground. Google's VRP program provides the watch cradles by invitation only (still waiting for mine ). As such, a DIY solution needs to be created to make this process more accessible. The most reliable solution I can think of currently is using PCBite SP10 probes to connect to the USB pins. Once I get my PCBite, I will post a setup picture. Another solution I'm going to try is inserting pogo pins into a replacement silicone watch band to connect to the USB pins. Similarly, the pins have a 1.27mm spacing which you can find headers for online. That in combination with some helping hands could give a somewhat janky connection. Huge thanks to Asmita Jha (Twitter @aj_0x00) who was there during the first 2 days of the rooting attempts and helped troubleshoot throughout. Additionally, big thanks to Stack Smashing (Twitter @ghidraninja) for giving us the idea to patch the Magisk file on the watch itself, instead of patching the boot image on another device running Magisk. Additionally, thanks to the Google team who gave us access to device and the prototype cradles to interface with the watch reliably. To make the process more accessible, a cheap interfacing solution needs to be created. Please reach out if have any questions, concerns, or information that would make the process easier. You can find me on Twitter Thanks!"

            "text": "How to root Google Pixel Watch using Magisk:Note that this rooting process was performed with a special USB-C cradle provided by the Google Team. I would not recommend flashing the device without a stable connection to the pins under the wrist strap. I might attempt to make a 3D printed enclosure that uses pogo pins. Additionally, this process will wipe the device. The USB pins are under the watch band closest to the secondary button. From left to right, the pins are voltage, data+, data-, and ground. Google's VRP program provides the watch cradles by invitation only (still waiting for mine ). As such, a DIY solution needs to be created to make this process more accessible. The most reliable solution I can think of currently is using PCBite SP10 probes to connect to the USB pins. Once I get my PCBite, I will post a setup picture. Another solution I'm going to try is inserting pogo pins into a replacement silicone watch band to connect to the USB pins. Similarly, the pins have a 1.27mm spacing which you can find headers for online. That in combination with some helping hands could give a somewhat janky connection. Huge thanks to Asmita Jha (Twitter @aj_0x00) who was there during the first 2 days of the rooting attempts and helped troubleshoot throughout. Additionally, big thanks to Stack Smashing (Twitter @ghidraninja) for giving us the idea to patch the Magisk file on the watch itself, instead of patching the boot image on another device running Magisk. Additionally, thanks to the Google team who gave us access to device and the prototype cradles to interface with the watch reliably. To make the process more accessible, a cheap interfacing solution needs to be created. Please reach out if have any questions, concerns, or information that would make the process easier. You can find me on Twitter Thanks!",

Here’s why. Back in early 2000, when Kyocera VP-210 was launched, Japan became the first country to sell camera equipped phones. These phones also had the ability to send photos via email (pretty astonishing for 2000, isn’t it?). When users started to get used to them and learned how to attach pictures to an email, a big problem started to emerge: as any citizen of a civilized society would do, , especially in crowded places like trains! By 2001, this was already a matter of online discussion and, because no legal provision has been taken by the government, wireless carriers took it upon themselves. In order to , carriers made it a requirement that all phones sold in Japan must be customized for the market so that Phone producers and Japanese wireless carriers have cooperated ever since so that all phones make a distinct sound whenever you use the camera."

Hey! I'm in love with my Google Pixel 6 Pro, however, I don't like the screen at all, I wanted to be able to customize how it looks. Been looking for a way to modify how it looks, CF.lumen fixed the white balance, Sa2ration changes the saturation of your display, you can decrease it all you want, or make it as saturated as you want. All this apps should/may work on other devices too. [Paid app, HBM to use the max brightness of the device without auto brightness] Enable HBM in app and then enable and disable auto brightness in phone settings, not app settings, that way you will have the absolute maximum brightness of the display, you can enable on the app settings restore hbm after screen off to have it at max brightness always. *There is a QS hbm toggle too* For CF.lumen, enable location, set permissions for the app and do the following: 1 - Location, tap to update or input manually any location, that's only to avoid crashes when manually changing white balance, disable location after that if you don't need it. 2 - Master filter mode, custom, there you can modify RGB values to your taste, I use 0.955 on Red, 0.975 on Green, 1.000 on Blue, but feel free to try until you enjoy how it looks. Now, for Sa2ration, after installing, simply move the slider until you like that you have, if it does not change, use the setting \"enable color management\" it's kinda glitchy and may requiere it or not on your device, I use 1.10, really like how it looks! [Bonus, under developer settings, you can fully hide the display cutout, I also recommend to set the dpi to 410-430 with or without cutout as it will make some landscape animations a single slide instead of two, try pulling down notification panel when landscape mode, try all animations 0.5x too, you may like how it looks, if you see an app crashing disable developer settings as it may create issues like that sometimes] [Bonus 2, try Iconify magisk module, you can customize your Pixel with that, even enable pure dark oled theme, thanks to Facundo Holzmeister from on tiktok!] Hopefully this will be useful for someone, try and enjoy!"

Hey! I'm in love with my Google Pixel 6 Pro, however, I don't like the screen at all, I wanted to be able to customize how it looks. Been looking for a way to modify how it looks, CF.lumen fixed the white balance, Sa2ration changes the saturation of your display, you can decrease it all you want, or make it as saturated as you want. All this apps should/may work on other devices too. [Paid app, HBM to use the max brightness of the device without auto brightness] Enable HBM in app and then enable and disable auto brightness in phone settings, not app settings, that way you will have the absolute maximum brightness of the display, you can enable on the app settings restore hbm after screen off to have it at max brightness always. *There is a QS hbm toggle too* For CF.lumen, enable location, set permissions for the app and do the following: 1 - Location, tap to update or input manually any location, that's only to avoid crashes when manually changing white balance, disable location after that if you don't need it. 2 - Master filter mode, custom, there you can modify RGB values to your taste, I use 0.955 on Red, 0.975 on Green, 1.000 on Blue, but feel free to try until you enjoy how it looks. Now, for Sa2ration, after installing, simply move the slider until you like that you have, if it does not change, use the setting \"enable color management\" it's kinda glitchy and may requiere it or not on your device, I use 1.10, really like how it looks! [Bonus, under developer settings, you can fully hide the display cutout, I also recommend to set the dpi to 410-430 with or without cutout as it will make some landscape animations a single slide instead of two, try pulling down notification panel when landscape mode, try all animations 0.5x too, you may like how it looks, if you see an app crashing disable developer settings as it may create issues like that sometimes] [Bonus 2, try Iconify magisk module, you can customize your Pixel with that, even enable pure dark oled theme, thanks to Facundo Holzmeister from on tiktok!] Hopefully this will be useful for someone, try and enjoy!",

It is unknown if fastboot was working earlier (I recently downloaded SDK yesterday), however, I tested fastboot on my Pixel 4 XL and it works. I used the web flasher and chose clean install for this. I will try again with another clean install. EDIT: I reinstalled the ROM and fastboot now works."

Here´s a build for those that dare trying or simply want to run a mainline kernel on their phone. I don´t plan to update this much outside of the scope that googles does and what I already did. It´s more of a proof of concept and I think there are at least some that would be eager to try. I was able to daily drive it two days without a single crash, due to disablng WiFi Calling and by not using my USB C buds, but rather bluetooth buds. However now I´m back to 5.10 as it´s really just a piece of concept. Essentially mainline GKI kernel with downstream android driver changes. Some pieces that are in the 5.10 kernel that haven´t been brought to 5.15 yet, are missing. Feel free to report bugs and I will add them to the list. However if you have issues you have been warned - Based on latest kernel sources from Google for 5.15 , removed faulty hints when running powerhint mainline module fixed when running powerhint_mainline module usb c hub now works, connect mouse to usb c hub works too - USB-C headphones do not output sound - USB-C to 3.5mm adapter is not working - having wifi calling/vowifi enabled makes a network driver crash the phone - fast charging is not working correctly on my end - probably many more I didn´t notice Download is always located in this folder: Initial Release - unlocked Bootloader - USB-Debugging in developer options enabled - latest adb and fastboot binaries - working adb and fastboot environment - vbmeta flashed with disabling verification and verity flags (check process ) 1. Download the images provided in the downloads section to your PC. 2. Download the powerhint magisk module for mainline found in downloads section and flash it via Magisk Manager like any other magisk module. 3. (different to the regular Kirisakura Kernel) 4. Don´t forget to patch the boot.img with Magisk Manager prior to flashing it. 3. Magisk-patched boot.img, dtbo.img and vendor_boot.img need to be flashed in while vendor_dlkm needs to be flashed via , either via the option in Magisk Manager or via adb command: Commands: 4. Reboot either via buttons or by typing 5.

Here´s a build for those that dare trying or simply want to run a mainline kernel on their phone. I don´t plan to update this much outside of the scope that googles does and what I already did. It´s more of a proof of concept and I think there are at least some that would be eager to try. I was able to daily drive it two days without a single crash, due to disablng WiFi Calling and by not using my USB C buds, but rather bluetooth buds. However now I´m back to 5.10 as it´s really just a piece of concept. Essentially mainline GKI kernel with downstream android driver changes. Some pieces that are in the 5.10 kernel that haven´t been brought to 5.15 yet, are missing. Feel free to report bugs and I will add them to the list. However if you have issues you have been warned - Based on latest kernel sources from Google for 5.15 , removed faulty hints when running powerhint mainline module fixed when running powerhint_mainline module usb c hub now works, connect mouse to usb c hub works too - USB-C headphones do not output sound - USB-C to 3.5mm adapter is not working - having wifi calling/vowifi enabled makes a network driver crash the phone - fast charging is not working correctly on my end - probably many more I didn´t notice Download is always located in this folder: Initial Release - unlocked Bootloader - USB-Debugging in developer options enabled - latest adb and fastboot binaries - working adb and fastboot environment - vbmeta flashed with disabling verification and verity flags (check process ) 1. Download the images provided in the downloads section to your PC. 2. Download the powerhint magisk module for mainline found in downloads section and flash it via Magisk Manager like any other magisk module. 3. (different to the regular Kirisakura Kernel) 4. Don´t forget to patch the boot.img with Magisk Manager prior to flashing it. 3. Magisk-patched boot.img, dtbo.img and vendor_boot.img need to be flashed in while vendor_dlkm needs to be flashed via , either via the option in Magisk Manager or via adb command: Commands: 4. Reboot either via buttons or by typing 5.

                    "text": "[Guide] Get Daydream working on the Pixel 6 Pro:Hey everyone, so I know many people have been disappointed(and angry), including myself, that Google has discontinued daydream. However, after a week of tinkering with stuff, I finally was able to get it working on my rooted Pixel 6 Pro! Albeit, it's buggy, and most apps don't even work anymore. But overall, it runs good considering it's not even suppose to be running on Android 12, let alone the Pixel 6. Below I will outline steps in order to get it to work on your rooted Pixel 6 pro(and I assume on the Pixel 6 as well). And I'll list a few apps I found that still work properly. -------------------------------------------------------- Daydream Pixel 6 workaround- Everything should be setup at this point. It might not load the first couple times you try it, but if you exit out, and restart it, it should work. Sometimes when you try to connect your controller, it won't connect the first time(might be due to it being a Bluetooth low energy device. So if it doesn't, connect it to the charger, and hold the two bottom buttons for about 5 seconds. Hit \"Try again\" on the screen, push the daydream button, and it should successfully connect.) For some reason, you must install the most recent version of the Daydream app first to set it up. If you try to install an older version first, the app will try to connect to Google, and it will give an error message. The most recent version of Daydream actually does work though, but the screen will be distorted, and that's why I installed a previous version, with will give you a correct aspect ratio. -------------------------------------------------------- Now for apps. First, the google play store will not work through the daydream headset. You will have to download apps by either browsing through the daydream app, or searching on the google play store. As I stated above, you unfortunately won't find many apps that work, and many developers have pulled their VR versions of their apps off the store(so you may have to download apks if you want to test to see if an app works). With that being said, here are a few apps I found that still successfully work. - The only browser I could find that still works. And it works pretty damn well. Plus the user interface is awesome. You can watch some streaming services too! From the ones I tested, you can watch HBO Max, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get Netflix or Disney Plus running, but you might find others that work. You can download the apk (this is the only version that works) - Surprisingly this is still listed on the google play store. And that's the one you can download; no need to install an older version. And it works perfectly! - This has been my go-to video player since I first bought my daydream. And it still works. You're able to play mostly any VR videos that you have stored on your device, or stream mostly any VR videos by pasting the streaming link in the app. You can download in the google play store. - Surprised Google hasn't delisted this app yet from the google play store. Again, no need to download an older version. This version works perfectly! - Haven't tested many games yet, but this one still works. And it's still listed in the google play store. It's playable, but it may crash occasionally while you're playing it. -------------------------------------------------------- Some apps I tested that didn't work- -------------------------------------------------------- Feel free to comment below on any apps you have found to still work. And feel free to test different versions of non-working apps I listed above, to see if any do work(I didn't have the time/patient to go through every one). If you have any questions, feel free to message, and I'll try to answer to the best of my technical ability. Have fun!"

I do, and it connects, and everything seems happy - but then the 2D \"put your phone in your headset\" screen comes up again for a couple seconds, then it registers that it's in one, and brings the main Daydream landing area back up again, where I stay, but with zero controller :-( ... I tried the plugging it in and resetting it and reconnecting, nothing ... tried killing BT for a couple minutes then turning it back on and reconnecting, nothing ... tried unpairing, and then it just brings me through pairing again, and then does the same loop, insert in headset, connect controller, insert in headset, no controller to be found (but also not prompting about it oddly) ... Anyone seen similar and know a solution? I tried with both Daydream versions above (which both have correct aspect ratio for me) but I have the controller problem with both :-("

Taking it out and putting it back in after that, it brings me to the store page for Daydream, but it says it's not compatible - so I installed the versions from this thread, which enabled me to do the setup at least. From there I had the previously described aspect ratio issue, so I uninstalled Daydream and installed the older version, also as described in this thread. From there, I am able to launch Daydream, have a working controller, and am able to see the landing environment and (eventually) menu. Trying to start SkyboxVR results in a 'This can only be run on Daydream compatible devices'. Trying to launch something in VR from Chrome (we ALL know what I'm talking about), results in Daydream launching, but it just leaves me at the landing environment with the menu ... I never get the full screen VR browser that I do with my Pixel 2 XL when I launch the same VR site from Chrome. Firefox Reality (also from this thread I believe) does work, but I can't launch the VR version of that same website from it. When I click the VR button it brings me to a page listing supported devices, and when I click the link anyway to go to vr.youknowwhatsiteI'mtalkingabout it loads the page but the \"Launch VR\" button is just a loading spiral forever. SO... progress, but, nothing of use yet sadly. I'm trying really hard to get this working as my P2XL is sluggish and just overheats within just a few minutes of starting VR... and I'm trying REALLY hard to resist the urge to purchase a newly discounted Quest 2 as I'd like to wait for a Quest 3 in the fall! So, I'll keep at it, and keep updating here in case anyone else ever finds themselves in the same boat trying to get Daydream working with a much newer device than it was intended for."

            "text": "[Guide] Get Daydream working on the Pixel 6 Pro:Hey everyone, so I know many people have been disappointed(and angry), including myself, that Google has discontinued daydream. However, after a week of tinkering with stuff, I finally was able to get it working on my rooted Pixel 6 Pro! Albeit, it's buggy, and most apps don't even work anymore. But overall, it runs good considering it's not even suppose to be running on Android 12, let alone the Pixel 6. Below I will outline steps in order to get it to work on your rooted Pixel 6 pro(and I assume on the Pixel 6 as well). And I'll list a few apps I found that still work properly. -------------------------------------------------------- Daydream Pixel 6 workaround- Everything should be setup at this point. It might not load the first couple times you try it, but if you exit out, and restart it, it should work. Sometimes when you try to connect your controller, it won't connect the first time(might be due to it being a Bluetooth low energy device. So if it doesn't, connect it to the charger, and hold the two bottom buttons for about 5 seconds. Hit \"Try again\" on the screen, push the daydream button, and it should successfully connect.) For some reason, you must install the most recent version of the Daydream app first to set it up. If you try to install an older version first, the app will try to connect to Google, and it will give an error message. The most recent version of Daydream actually does work though, but the screen will be distorted, and that's why I installed a previous version, with will give you a correct aspect ratio. -------------------------------------------------------- Now for apps. First, the google play store will not work through the daydream headset. You will have to download apps by either browsing through the daydream app, or searching on the google play store. As I stated above, you unfortunately won't find many apps that work, and many developers have pulled their VR versions of their apps off the store(so you may have to download apks if you want to test to see if an app works). With that being said, here are a few apps I found that still successfully work. - The only browser I could find that still works. And it works pretty damn well. Plus the user interface is awesome. You can watch some streaming services too! From the ones I tested, you can watch HBO Max, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get Netflix or Disney Plus running, but you might find others that work. You can download the apk (this is the only version that works) - Surprisingly this is still listed on the google play store. And that's the one you can download; no need to install an older version. And it works perfectly! - This has been my go-to video player since I first bought my daydream. And it still works. You're able to play mostly any VR videos that you have stored on your device, or stream mostly any VR videos by pasting the streaming link in the app. You can download in the google play store. - Surprised Google hasn't delisted this app yet from the google play store. Again, no need to download an older version. This version works perfectly! - Haven't tested many games yet, but this one still works. And it's still listed in the google play store. It's playable, but it may crash occasionally while you're playing it. -------------------------------------------------------- Some apps I tested that didn't work- -------------------------------------------------------- Feel free to comment below on any apps you have found to still work. And feel free to test different versions of non-working apps I listed above, to see if any do work(I didn't have the time/patient to go through every one). If you have any questions, feel free to message, and I'll try to answer to the best of my technical ability. Have fun!",

Slide the view field around to see the entire photo. But THANKS for the references. Edited to add: Okay, I am amazed (easily impressed, perhaps). I copied an ascii text file, a spreadsheet and a pdf to the watch. The text file just opened and I could read it, It looks as if I could also edit it. The excel spreadsheet (no app to open prompts). The pdf file opened as pdf could not be navigated. But it also offered text view and I was able to read it. Now, obviously the screen a(watchface) is a bit constrained but... Still impressed."

Same image scrolled to reveal different sections. Screen capture of a text file I transferred to the watch. The watch or the inherent app actually \"word wrapped\" the plain text file.

Similarly, a way to possibly copy text or jpg images to the watch if there is a way to display them from some ascii text reader app or image display app. I sometimes like to have a simple note about how to do something on my portable device. I see a thread on using some \"nav-xxx\" but since it is not available in the PlayStore, I don't see how to get it on the watch in the first place. I also saw a thread on some other method but when I fired it up - I was lost!!!! I have dealt with computers for eons so should be able to manage but those same eons may have resulted in my gray matter is stretched thin. Thanks in advance.",

Using on P6 as well and already smashed the phone on concrete several times when felt out from pocket during riding motorbikes). Unfortunately, Speck does not make Presidio Grip case for Pixel 7 that would be my no 1 choice. Screen protection: Reminds me for L&K protectors, but biggest downside that will pill up from sides (depends on case) over time. There are similar non glass protectors using GEL to stick properly to screen, those will not pill up easily. Got on P6 like that, and still holds after a year usage."

Root was successful however, I'm mistakenly hit restart and now my root is gone.:I had a root installed on my Google pixel 7 and the little update dialogue popped up for me to restart now and instead of closing it out I accidentally hit restart. Now my phone rebooted. I went to check to see if root was still there and root checker says it's not installed properly. Magisk is still installed but it doesn't give me no ability to do super user options. It's grayed out. What can I do to get root back on this phone because I have an app that's fully root dependent and won't work without it.",

No particular apps are draining the battery, phone idle alone does it. I thought after the June update, it will make the battery backup better but I think it made it even worse. Last night I charged my phone to 100% and slept by turning off WiFi and mobile data. I even kept my network type to 3G to avoid background activities from 4G. And waking up after 5-6 hrs of sleep, I found my battery to be 89%. Screenshot is attached below. This is very disappointing. I bought this phone on February. It has not been a year and this is the performance I get from a flagship? Clearly, this is not normal. Phone Idle draining 78%(of the 11% actual battery drain) of my phone's battery is crazy. I used to get 2 days of battery backup before that March update. And now I can hardly survive 16hrs. Please help me with a fix. Notes: Country: Bangladesh I use dual SIM. 1 physical and 1 e-SIM."

So of course 78% of that small amount of battery drain is going to be due to the idle because idling is what is doing 78% of the time. I really don't see any issue here. I mean you only lost 11% battery over 4 hours and that first 15% drains quicker because lithium ion battery drain isn't linear. That first 10% always goes faster than the rest of the device. If it really bothers you, I would suggest changing the doze parameters to wear it disables the sensors on the device until it's unlocked."

I believe all of it does except for the GMS does magisk module. If you scroll all the way down to the bottom there's a setting that says wait for unlock. That keeps the phone in deep doze mode until you unlock the device, which also keeps the sensors turned off as well. Another option is diamond John's app Temefi. In the search box, type in doze, and you'll see a place where you can choose from several different Doze profiles. For this you need root, but if you're not rooted I would stick with nap time which just needs some ADB commands entered"

            "text": "Pixel 7 Battery Drain in Phone Idle:I've been noticing huge battery drain on my Pixel 7 after the March update. No particular apps are draining the battery, phone idle alone does it. I thought after the June update, it will make the battery backup better but I think it made it even worse. Last night I charged my phone to 100% and slept by turning off WiFi and mobile data. I even kept my network type to 3G to avoid background activities from 4G. And waking up after 5-6 hrs of sleep, I found my battery to be 89%. Screenshot is attached below. This is very disappointing. I bought this phone on February. It has not been a year and this is the performance I get from a flagship? Clearly, this is not normal. Phone Idle draining 78%(of the 11% actual battery drain) of my phone's battery is crazy. I used to get 2 days of battery backup before that March update. And now I can hardly survive 16hrs. Please help me with a fix. Notes: Country: Bangladesh I use dual SIM. 1 physical and 1 e-SIM.",

Depending on how that magnet works in relation to things like reverse charging, that wasn't something Google implemented to be used. If it was a factory Google case then I would understand. Like I said though I do see your point. I would suggest anyone who's able to root, flash a custom ROM like lineage and you won't deal with any of these heating issues. Android 14 also runs a lot cooler because it doesn't have the issue with pixel launcher anymore, at least it seems that way so far."

After solving some doubts, such as installing the stock pixel camera simply by installing it from the play store, I have several more doubts that have yet to be resolved: 1. One of the reasons why I installed LineageOS was for the native recording of calls, something very important to me and that I missed from my Xiaomi phones with xiaomi.eu rom. However, do you know if there is a way that it can be set to record all calls BY DEFAULT? Currently you have to activate it in each call you make with the phone. 2. For my taste, the launcher is missing a couple of details that could be corrected with Nova. I want to take advantage of the fact that the launcher respects privacy and keep the one that Lineage brings. However, I miss being able to better manage and manipulate the widgets and being able to expand the app grid from the maximum allowed, which is 6x6. Do you know if there is any way to improve these two aspects with the launcher that Lineage brings or any other open source launcher? Thanks in advance !"

No matter for me and I don't see things as a privacy threats as long as all outgoing and unnecessary DNS requests or IP addresses are blocked, and everything works. I'm fine. I decide per app basis. It would be wonderful if I knew the purpose of contacting this address, and decide to let it pass rather than strictly block all outgoing connections for everything and then check logs and make actions but a bit of transparency is too much to ask for. I've installed and tested Lawnchair v2 for testing yesterday and whenever you open the \"About\" tab, it trying to reach github 185.199.111.133. In this case it's easy to track - it trying to get all info about developers, icons, then why not allow it or just keep blocking and not creating extra unnecessary firewall rule. If you ask me, it would be better if this was hard coded into app for 1MB more app size."

Do you know if there is any way to improve these two aspects with the launcher that Lineage brings or any other open source launcher? Thanks in advance !",

He could've changed the premium app cost or even worse, started charging annually for updates as so many other apps have done. If you're worried about an app being open or closed source, why not just pay $30 a month and get Ooma Office which comes with call recordings. I did that recently as I don't have phones I can root currently. Closed source apps that have a license to use, aren't bad. The reason you have a closed source app is so people can't just pirate your work."

You might have heard about all the controversy that Google Pixel`s December update sparked, dropped phone calls, bad reception, tons of issues fixed and another tons of new issues introduced. Well, the wait is over - Google promised to deliver a fix to the fix and here it is the Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro January update! Let`s see how well they did! How does it work for you? Telephony fixed, i.e. call reception, call handover and etc? Sadly I live in a \"none Pixel supported\" country, so no support from the operators resulting into no 5G, no Carrier Aggregation, even no LTE+ (only LTE) and sadly no VoLTE and VoWiFi."

It is interesting that there are people who had the problem and january update did not fix these, people which started having problems after january update and people whose problems were fixed after january update. Go figure what exactly google are doing with the modem but obviously it needs more work. I personally never got the december update and did not have any problems with november one. Now after january update i am also ok but on LTE only as 5G is locked in my country. I also have turned off adaptive connectivity and do not have volte or vowifi enabled (again locked in my country)."

You might have heard about all the controversy that Google Pixel`s December update sparked, dropped phone calls, bad reception, tons of issues fixed and another tons of new issues introduced. Well, the wait is over - Google promised to deliver a fix to the fix and here it is the Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro January update! Let`s see how well they did! How does it work for you? Telephony fixed, i.e. call reception, call handover and etc? Sadly I live in a \"none Pixel supported\" country, so no support from the operators resulting into no 5G, no Carrier Aggregation, even no LTE+ (only LTE) and sadly no VoLTE and VoWiFi.",

I can still get in to fastboot and all the options. No idea what to try next. If I took it to where I bought it, would they send it off to Google and they can fix it? Or do I have a brand new $1150 paperweight? Thanks for any help.....",

Haven't notice any features/hardware/whatever not working, except for some apps, who require full google services. I can't make out any change in battery life compared to the stock rom. Not missing any google annoyances (like that assistance), however picture quality seems to be not too great. But I would need to test everything a bit more in depth."

However I plan on using both esim & sim simultaneous soon, but so far I could not test this. On a more general note, battery seems to be depleted slightly faster vs. the stock rom. By slightly I mean almost unnoticeable. Not sure whether battery percentage is calculated the same way (I assume it does), but this is this only benchmark I have, because I have not manage to bring the battery below 50%. One of my theories is that stock rom handles roaming or search for new network better. Other than that, CalyxOS has been running reliably for 149 hours. Bluetooth connects a little slower, but I'd rather not sent out beacons all the time. Planned on testing though if I feel lazy I might just stay with this one."

Presumably due to hardware, Wireless charging works fine. Stats on charging (voltage and power) are not present. I liked to see the charging rate in Havoc OS. Very likely I'm gonna stay with Calyx OS. Not a huge fan of automatic updates, however might be a good idea. Ran out of use cases to test, open for requests.

The following devices have been tested and confirmed to work: NOTE: This should work on the variants of these phones as well, like the Pixel 6 Pro or 6a, however they have not been tested. NOTE: In previous versions of this guide, the OnePlus seriers of phones was supported, that is no longer the case, as since OxygenOS 12, custom AVB keys are no longer supported by the bootloader on those devices. For simplicities sake, all further references will only be to the Google Pixel 6 (oriole). And now on with the show! You need a few places to store things, so create some working directories: You also need to add \"~/android/lineageos/out/host/linux-x86/bin\" to your shell's profile path. Make sure to close and restart your session afterwards otherwise the signing will fail later on with a \"file not found\" error message (this may no longer be required). The Pixel 6 device files are mostly contained in the shared \"raviole\" and \"gs101\" devices for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. You will need to add a few parameters to the shared make file found here: ~/android/lineageos/device/google/raviole/BoardConfigLineage.mk, they are: Note you cannot use \"~\" in the path names above to signify your home directory, so give the full absolute path to make sure the files are found. LineageOS by default disables Android Verified Boot's partition verification, but you can enable it now as all the required parts will be in place. To enable partition verification do the following: To set the correct signing key to use for AVB, do the following: Don't forget to replace your in the first sed command above with your current logged in user id. You also need to patch the Makefile included with AOSP as it will otherwise fail during the build. The required patch can be found here: Download it and store in ~/android/oriole/patches. Now apply it with the following command: If you would like to know more about this patch, see the additional info at the bottom of this post. NOTE: This step is no longer required as a patch to LineageOS to include it has been committed. You are now ready to build: You are now ready to sign the apks with sign_target_files_apks: Now it is time to complete the OTA package: Note, replace [date] with today's date in YYYYMMDD format. Before you can lock your phone, you have to tell it what your public key is so it knows it can trust your build. To do this you need to create a pkmd.bin file: Note: if you don't have a releasekey.key file in your certificate directory, use the following command to generate one: It's time to flash your build to your phone. The following steps assume you have already unlocked your phone and have flashed an official version of LineageOS to it. You don't need to have flashed LineageOS yet, you can use the recovery that was just created, it is located in ~/android/lineageos/out/target/product/oriole and is called vendor_boot.img. Reboot your phone in to recovery mode In LineageOS Recovery return to the main menu and select \"Apply update\", then \"Apply from ADB\". From your PC, run: When the sideload is complete, reboot into LineageOS. Make sure everything looks good with your build. You may also need to format your data partition at this time depending on what you had installed on your phone previously, it's best to do so anyway. In LineageOS Recovery return to the main menu and select \"Factory reset\", then \"Format data/factory reset\", then confirm with \"Format data\". Now it's time to add your signing key to the Android Verified Boot process. To do so, do the following: Note: If you have already flashed a custom avb key you must erase it before flashing the new one, use \"fastboot erase avb_custom_key\" to do so. Your phone will then factory reset and then reboot in to LineageOS. Which of course means you have to go through the first time setup wizard, so do so now. Congratulations! Your boot loader is now locked, but you can still unlock it again using fastboot, so it's time to disable that as well. You can! See for more details. Well at least you will be able to if the pvmfw partition gets added to the official LineageOS builds. For Android Verified Boot (AVB) to work, it must have the hash values for each of the system/vendor/boot/dtbo/etc. partitions stored in vbmeta. Official LineageOS builds for oriole do include the vendor.img in them along with everything else that is needed, however that is not true for all phones. An \"issue\" that might stop someone from using the official oriole builds is that AVB is enabled in the official LineageOS builds but does not validate the hash trees during boot which limits the protection offered. During a boot you will of course see the standard power up screen, followed by the yellow \"custom os\" message and then the standard LineageOS boot animation. For more details on AVB boot messages, see AOSP's default Makefile makes an assumption that when AVB is enabled, that all the img files will be available well before vbmeta.img is created. This is simply NOT true and AOSP seems to know this as well from the following comment in the Makefile: These two calls eventual evaluate to returning the path to the partitions based upon the INSTALLED_*IMAGE_TARGET variable, which isn't created until later in the build process. Because of this, the command to build vbmeta.img gets corrupted due to the missing make variable being empty and an invalid command line is passed to avbtool near the end of the build. The corruption happens due to the fact that the following line from the original Makefile: Gets added to the avbtool call even if \"$(call images-for-partitions,$(1))\" turns out to be an empty string. Avbtool then throws an error message as it is expecting a parameter after the \"--include_descriptors_from_image\" flag that is added for the \"empty\" partition path. The fix is to call \"$(call images-for-partitions,$(1))\" earlier, set it to a variable and check to make sure it isn't an empty string before letting the \"--include_descriptors_from_image\" be added to the avbtool command line to be used later. This technically generates an incomplete vbmeta.img file during the build process, but since the signing process recreates it from scratch anyway; no harm, no foul."

The phone store don't accept the return of the device through the warranty because when I took the phone to the city center where the shop is located, it catches an excellent network signal, and they say everything's fine, but as soon as you go outside the center (even just two blocks) everything is much worse.

(THIS WILL WORK ANY PIXEL, I HAPPENED TO TEST THIS ON A PIXEL 4A 5G BUT THIS WILL WORK ON ANY RECENT PIXEL) You first have to go to settings... Apps and then show system apps What we are doing here is disabling a system app that has SIM lock. Search up \"device setup\" Ok ok, so now go to Mobile Data and Wifi and Disable background data Now go to App battery usage and put it as restricted Insert your SIM Card and it will be sim unlocked"

While it did work for the physical SIM at first, I have it set up with a T mobile eSIM and it won't work with both like it did before. Now if take the visible SIM out, T mobile works, but Visible won't work at all in it. I was using a 4a that I bought as a temporary/spare phone until my replacement battery for my 4a5g came in (it took about a month). I decided to do a factory reset because I figured it would be easier to just let it copy everything from the 4a, but it relocked the SIM which I should have realized before I did it, but I didn't think about it. I'm going to do another factory reset and try again... I'll update soon."

Apps and then show system apps What we are doing here is disabling a system app that has SIM lock. Search up \"device setup\" Ok ok, so now go to Mobile Data and Wifi and Disable background data Now go to App battery usage and put it as restricted Insert your SIM Card and it will be sim unlocked",

Some Steps that I identified. 1- Convert my X86_64 AOSP Android 12 Custom ROM => ARM. 2- De-activate BootLoader . 3- Flash my Pixel 6. Would you help me if these steps are correct?

It would need analogue audio out, preferably via USB-C as opposed to the obsolete 3.5mm connector from the 1950's. My old Pixel 2 requires a relatively expensive pair of USB-C earphones with its own (crappy quality) DAC chip. I think the Pixel 5 doesn't provide analogue audio through the USB-C port neither (correct me if I'm wrong). I once had a Sony XZ2 Compact which provided analogue audio out through the USB-C port which meant I could use cheaper earphones and would ironically still sound better due to a better DAC chip built into the phone itself. I would love to have a compact Pixel which has a little fat form factor like a Sony XZ2 Compact. Am currently still using my Pixel 4a . I like it and all and was the best choice available to me at the time I had to buy a new phone, but is still too big to use single handed comfortably and is restrictive in my pocket when climbing around tight spaces on construction sites. There are other small phones out there, but they don't support custom OS with relockable bootloader such as GrapheneOS or CalyxOS."

If your not, you must flash a Google factory image for Android 12 Barbet This is based on the Android Open Source Project. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. It does still include various proprietary hardware-specific code. Gapps must be flashed separately and are not included in this ROM. All the source code is available in the Github repo . Thanks go to Github and LineageOS for their source code and device specific code. I couldn't have built this without it!!! The ROM uses the LineageOS source code, device specific code and proprietary blobs. I made other minor changes and used compression to lower the file size of the ROM, creating more space in the internal storage with minor reduction in performance. Repo Synced every three days to keep the code base fresh. Also updated daily with minor changes. NO NEED TO DOWNLOAD PE BARBET ZIPS. THAT PERTAINS TO MY OTHER ROM!!!!! #1 REBOOT TO BOOTLOADER #2 FACTORY RESET #3 BOOT TWRP (DO NOT FLASH IT!!!): #4 SIDELOAD ROM IN TWRP: ADVANCED, ADB SIDELOAD #5 SIDELOAD GAPPS: #6 REBOOT TO SYSTEM #7 REBOOT TO LINEAGE RECOVERY IF YOU WISH TO ROOT SIDELOAD MAGISK.APK #8 REBOOT TO SYSTEM Screen call and Google assistant works."

            "text": "[CLOSED] LineageOS Rom for Pixel 5a Android 11 - April 16, 2022:You MUST be on Android 11 to use this!!!!! If your not, you must flash latest Google factory image for Android 11 This is based on the Android Open Source Project. It can be used without any need to have any Google application installed. It does still include various proprietary hardware-specific code. Gapps must be flashed separately and are not included in this ROM. All the source code is available in the Github repo . You can also view the changelog for a full list of changes & features . Thanks go to Github and LineageOS for their source code and device specific code. I couldn't have built this without it!!! The ROM uses the LineageOS source code, device specific code and proprietary blobs. I made other minor changes and used compression to lower the file size of the ROM, creating more space in the internal storage with minor reduction in performance. Repo Synced every three days to keep the code base fresh. Also updated daily with minor changes. FLASH BOOT TO BOTH SLOTS IN BOOTLOADER fastboot flash --slot all boot boot.img REBOOT TO RECOVERY FACTORY RESET SIDELOAD ROM IN RECOVERY adb sideload 20220416-barbet-OFFICIAL-signed.zip REBOOT TO RECOVERY. IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY SWITCH SLOTS SIDELOAD GAPPS adb sideload SayaGapps-mini-20220418-signed.zip REBOOT TO SYSTEM REBOOT TO RECOVERY TO ROOT SIDELOAD MAGISK.APK adb sideload magisk.apk REBOOT TO SYSTEM OTA updates are now available through the built in updater on the phone and are updated daily. Check settings, system, advanced, updater. Download and let update install. Reboot to system. You can change the preferences in the updater to check for updates automatically daily and you will get a notification when a update is available. Default setting is once a week. Root is now retained after update. No need to root again after applying update. Screen call now works with my latest gapps packages.",

She doesn't do any intensive gaming or anything but it works well for her, and the larger screen helps avoid straining her eyes. The battery is bigger than my 5's, too. The only differences between the 4a 5g, 5, and 5a are battery size and RAM. All 3 have the Snapdragon 765G; the 4a and 5a both have 6GB RAM, the 5 has 8. I would honestly avoid the 4 or 4XL."

The \"OEM Unlock\" greyed-out is most definitely due to it being a carrier locked device and you're out of luck. Also, if you truly want a de-googled OS, I recommend Graphene OS."

Other posts (not necessarily on this forum...can't remember) say: \"Pull out the simcard, disable Wifi and DON'T contact anything, only skip through the setup...\" At the moment I only have a simcard of the wrong size...but I enabled Wifi but did not update anything in fear of getting an even stronger patch to disable any form of tinkering. But as I am still having a locked \"OEM unlocking\" and a locked bootloader I am open for any kind of tinkering to get this damn thing freed. Would these steps ok: Start the phone, Setup lockscreen, dark theme, etc.. enable Wifi and download all updates, install updates Ok? Or what would you suggest? Cheers! Etymotics"

Here's my experience: I have several pixels, all unlocked. If I flash back to stock firmware and skip through setup without connecting to wifi, OEM unlock is greyed out. If I connect wifi on the first time through, it's available. I've also heard this in tech videos. However, it won't work with Verizon phones. But if yours isn't Verizon, this could be the reason you're not able to unlock."

The battery replacement didn't help, so I switched to a mid-range Realme. I am missing the Pixel experience and looking forward to rejoining the Pixel family. Pixels have never officially sold in my country, and since the war started, it's become even harder to find one on sale. Luckily, the local retailer has brand-new for a reasonable price (~$600 and ~$400 with taxes included), especially considering how our local currency is losing its value each day. I'm choosing between these two models. I am excited about its battery life; at the same time, it's not that large and heavy. However, I'm a bit concerned that it has only 6 GB of RAM, and the Snapdragon processor might be not too future-proof, as Google might save some features for their Tensor-based models. What do you think? Best, Andrii"

Google really made cheapest phone they could. Also idiots from google didn't enable VoLTE like normal company but they locked it so only \"certified\" carriers have it. This is my first and last pixel phone. Battery is great, cameras are standard Google reliable and good. Clean Android with regular updates is also good and everything just works."

The overheating issue isn't *terrible* if you're not a frequent user of video chat, but when you do need it, your phone is going to overheat and your radios shut off. I was trying to use a telehealth visit with my doctor for a recent diagnosis using 5G on Visible, and it keep shutting off the radio and freezing the phone. I had to use my wife's iPhone instead. The doctor couldn't even call my phone because it was locked up for 5 minutes. I'm on my 3rd Pixel 5a (due to screen breaks) they have all had the overheating issue. It won't come up for months but if/when it does come up it can be during a critical time."

            "text": "Pixel 5a - worth buying in 2022? 🤔:Greetings to Pixel 5a owners from Ukraine!! I was a happy Pixel 4a owner for some time, but battery life upset me. The battery replacement didn't help, so I switched to a mid-range Realme. I am missing the Pixel experience and looking forward to rejoining the Pixel family. Pixels have never officially sold in my country, and since the war started, it's become even harder to find one on sale. Luckily, the local retailer has brand-new for a reasonable price (~$600 and ~$400 with taxes included), especially considering how our local currency is losing its value each day. I'm choosing between these two models. I am excited about its battery life; at the same time, it's not that large and heavy. However, I'm a bit concerned that it has only 6 GB of RAM, and the Snapdragon processor might be not too future-proof, as Google might save some features for their Tensor-based models. What do you think? Best, Andrii",

This is what I have tried so far, but all in vain. Pixel5 (Build: RD1A.200810.022.A4) 1. I have unlocked Pixel5 (USA) bought directly from Google. I extracted boot.img and patched with Magisk to gain root access. Once rooted, I tried \"setprop sys.usb.config diag,usb\" but didn't see any impact on ports. 2. Found out that I will need userdebug vendor.img from for my build. I extracted it and flashed it \"adb reboot fastboot\" & \"fastboot flash vendor vendor.img\". Once did this, the phone gets stuck in bootloop. 3. I used factory images from for the above build and did \"flash_all.bat\". Phone came up fine with stock image and lost root access. Tried to flash the same vendor.img in fastbootd mode, and again got bricked. \"your device is corrupted and cannot be trusted\" and stuck in bootloop. 4. Restored the device again with factory image \"flash_all.bat\". I need to access the QPST/QXDM ports on this phone.

When I rebooted today and checked, the thing seemed to be working. Very odd, but perhaps patience is needed."

A week ago I update my pixel 5 to the new android 13 and after that I'm unable to use the new qr code scanner bottom on quick settings, the option is disabled and I don't know how to enable it. So I need to install a specific app or do some configuration on my phone?? I scan the qr codes with Lens and it's works fine. Any ideas of what's happening??? Thanks in advance.",
