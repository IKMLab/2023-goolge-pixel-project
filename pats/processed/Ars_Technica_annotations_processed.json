You can honestly get a great machine for around $1000-1500 and anything over $1500 is going to be pretty darn great. Just depends on your likes/dislikes."

Any DLC (e.g. unlocking \"full\" games or expansions) is unlikely to be supported for family sharing, although games bought straight from the App Store should be fine. But, as you imagine, it'll be kind of a PITA to go through every app - doing mass deletions from Storage would probably be the easiest way to do it."

My P4a is doing OK for the time being, so even though the 6a is available, I'd rather go further with the 6, even if I have to be more patient in that regard.",

If you use them for mobile service they can simply collect everything they want as it passes through their own equipment. Anything that is encrypted on your phone is safe from direct access from them whether they try to collect data on the phone itself or on the 'air' as it passes through their systems. They simply use voluntarily submitted usage data and collected metadata from connection points and location data from your usage. No need to fiddle in your phone or try to intercept anything between your watch and phone."

I have a Garmin Fenix 3 which will work perfectly fine with 100% functionality if the only thing you pair it to is a PC. You'll only miss out on notification of stuff like emails and IM messages... but since IM messages come through on your smartwatch instead of your PC, that's kind of a given. My wife has a Fitbit Versa 3 which also works well with a PC only, but it does work best with a smartphone. Both Garmin and Fitbit started out with products that were meant to pair first and foremost with a PC, before Apple launched the first product that worked exclusively with a smartphone. Both Garmin and Fitbit still provide a lot of functionality if you pair exclusively with a PC, but Fitbit's smartwatches work",

But when you lift up the lid on the laptop, not only is there a ton of dust throughout the keyboard, the part right between the bottom of the laptop screen right below the Dell logo... and the top part of the laptop keyboard, is very sticky. I notice this a long time ago and had no idea how that even happened. Its like gooey and sticky etc. Now the thing is where I stay at, its very humid so the dust on my laptop keyboard makes sense. But I have no idea how my laptop got so sticky. A while back I remember I had a tough time opening my laptop as in lifting the lid of it to use it because of the stickyness. I remember then using one of those lens wipes you use for laptop screens and glasses etc to get the stickyness out. But its still sticky. I can take a picture of it for you all to take a look but my whole keyboard has a ton of dust all over it. I also have an external keyboard that is very dirty as well. Can take picture of that as well. But I like the external keyboard so I never bought another one because this keyboard is comforatable."

But when you lift up the lid on the laptop, not only is there a ton of dust throughout the keyboard, the part right between the bottom of the laptop screen right below the Dell logo... and the top part of the laptop keyboard, is very sticky. I notice this a long time ago and had no idea how that even happened. Its like gooey and sticky etc. Now the thing is where I stay at, its very humid so the dust on my laptop keyboard makes sense. But I have no idea how my laptop got so sticky. A while back I remember I had a tough time opening my laptop as in lifting the lid of it to use it because of the stickyness. I remember then using one of those lens wipes you use for laptop screens and glasses etc to get the stickyness out. But its still sticky. I can take a picture of it for you all to take a look but my whole keyboard has a ton of dust all over it. I also have an external keyboard that is very dirty as well. Can take picture of that as well. But I like the external keyboard so I never bought another one because this keyboard is comforatable.",

For me it's not that big an issue, I'm used to it. When I see 2 or more emails at once it's too much to deal with on the watch really so I just swipe the notifications away and look at the phone if I'm curious to see more."

You should see shiny metal at the far end.",

However, I could see that the port was \"cracked\" open, and it looks like a lightning cable expanded the port vertically (if you have the phone lying face up).

The only way to charge the phone is to put a couple layers of painter's tape on the top of the lightning cable plug to push the plug downward and make contact with the pins inside the port."

For example, an iPhone SE (2016) still gets iOS 15, 5 years after it was launched. Whereas the OG Google Pixel lost Google's support in December 2019, a fiscal quarter past exactly 3 years after the device was first shipped.

It will take a while for all retailers and restaurants to phase them out. So until then, you're golden if you have a 2G phone. I have a crapton of devices in my collection that are either 2G only, or only have Euro 3G bands, and they all still work for voice and EDGE data."

I know that 3G on CDMA (CDMA20000, EVDO) wouldn't let you use voice and data at the same time because they were different networks and there would be contention over the modem/antenna, but ever since GSM networks hit 3G, voice has been transmitted over the same packet-switched network as data. Even though they used the exact same network software and hardware stack, turning off the \"data\" setting on your phone didn't turn off voice, it was just a software setting that blocked applications other than the Dialer from using data. Your carrier should be smart enough to not bill you for voice packets, and your phone OS should be smart enough not to allow application-layer packets over the network while still allowing packets from the Dialer app. It's more like an outbout firewall rule* than a hardware setting change."

Leave it plugged in all the time and it will never go past 85% or so. If you don't have a software option for that, just keep an eye on it and try to do the same. That or just look into buying a replacement battery for it. Wait for prices to go down as they become common and buy one before the price goes back up as they become harder to find. I got one for my Lenovo a while ago, I don't really need it yet, my battery still charges fine, just not as much as when new. The replacement was $25. I'll install it some day."

Still lasts around 4 hours of moderate use though, when it was new I could go 6-8 at best and this thing has a GeForce 920M in it using some power sometimes too. I checked the price I paid, it was actually more like $35 shipped so not quite as cheap as I thought, there are still some offers under $30 for it but the sellers are not too reliable looking."

Not to say they don't exist, but seriously, don't base buying a laptop on that. Especially when your only concern is phone battery life. Charge your phone through your laptop if it's that big of a deal. Buy a 20kmah battery pack. There is no good reason to have a WWAN adapter in a laptop at this point*, especially with hardware changes on the cellular side, like T-Mobile B12 support."

It's something I assumed every modern smartphone would have. It's handy for apps I don't use often enough to want on the desktop, but also for apps whose names begin with 'A'. No need for an desktop icon because they'll be at the start of the app drawer.",

It has a good amount of power (especially after a memory and HD upgrade) and has been able to handle everything I've thrown at it. The problem is that like other eMachines laptops the hinges have cracked. I tried, repeatedly, to get it replaced, but never got much response from eMachines and now that my warranty is expired and that they don't exist I doubt I'll ever get it replaced by them. Honestly, the system is fine and have not had any problems with it so far, but I'm worried that at some point I'll go to open/close the screen and the hinges will break. One possibly good thing is that I bought this at Best Buy and purchased the 3-year support plan. While I'm not sure how they will handle this I'm thinking of taking it in and seeing what they will do to either replace it or maybe they would have better luck getting it fixed by eMachines/Gateway. So here are my questions.If they opt to replace it would they give me the original purchase price ($1,499) towards a new machine? If so what would you all suggest as a replacement laptop that would stay within the original purchase price while getting the most bang for the buck?"

                    "text": "Buying cellphones online vs locally. Comments?:Hi guys. The two year contracts on my wife and my verizon phones have expired so we are free too look elsewhere. I was contemplating going with Cingular and getting the Nokia 6102 or Motorola V551 or RAZr. At this point I'm leaning to the Nokia for battery life and signal strength. I'm also looking at the Cingular Nation 700 minute family plan. These are the different prices I've found:Letstalk.complan w/2 year contract: 60.00/moNokia 6102: free (instant rebate)v550: free (instant rebate)RAZr: free (instant rebate)Wirefly.complan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: free w/180 day rebatev550: free w/180 day rebateRAZr: free w/180 day rebateverizon.complan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: $89v550: $99RAZr: $199Verizon local storeplan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: $89v550: $99RAZr: $199Am I missing something here? I read as much of the fine print as possible and it appears that the LetsTalk.com $60/mo contract for the Family Talk Nation 700 plan is identical in every way to the $69.99 Family Talk Nation 700 plan offered by Cingular and Wirefly. In addition, I get the instant rebate from letstalk.com rather than having to wait 180 days with wirefly and no rebate at all from Cingular online or B&M stores.I also assume that all of the taxes and fees that are percentage-based will be lower on a $60 plan rather than a $69.99 plan so I may save slightly more than $10/mo.Is there something I'm missing here? Some catch or fine print that I'm unaware of? If not, what reason is there for paying an extra $200 for the phones and an extra $10/mo to get the phone locally?"

My wife has Cingular so I tended towards that and I love the V3 Razr in black.Went to the Cingular web site and couldn't find anything I would consider a deal. There's a space on their site to enter your e-mail address and they'll e-mail you back a link to their Premier site with specials just for your company, base on your e-mail address.I put in my work address and promptly got an e-mail that working for my company entitled me to: a free Razr phone, free shipping, free $20 in accessories, and a 450 anytime/unlimited eve/wkend plan for $39.99/mo and a $36 activation fee. Sounded good but I wanted to run it by my wife that evening, I was at work.Later that night at home, the wife said sure, go for it. But from home I couldn't access my work e-mail to get the link. So I gave the website my home email, a standard isp address, out of desperation. The reply I got said that as a State of Texas employee I qualified for: a free Razr, free shipping, $25 in accessories, and the same plan for $33.99/mo and no activation fee!Despite the fact that I live in Iowa and do NOT work for the state of Texas, got my phone today and I love it!Sorry for the long story, but my point is, put in your e-mail address at the Cingular site and see what they offer you."

If the plan is $69.99 for 700 minutes, that's what you're gonna get, whatever the dealer says.Till a few weeks ago, Cingular used to sell its familyplans with just one line, the dirty bastards. You had to add a $10/mo line just to make it a family plan. Maybe the $10/mo cheaper dealer still has that plan in his software?Also, have you looked at T-Mobile? You should have good coverage in Texas."

Since you must have at least two lines to have a family talk plan, $70/month is essentially the price. That is, you'll never get the $60/month price, because you need at least two lines. It's been this way since June, when the plans changed over. You can't assign a single phone to a family talk plan... you can't now, and you couldn't a few weeks ago. The system won't let the CSR change it to that. You need to have two lines. The OLD plans (pre-June) let you do that, but they fixed that."

                    "text": "Well, I've learned a heck of a lot in the past week of cell phone research. Every time I look for something new (laptop, camera, phone, car) I plunge head first into the datastream and absorb as much as possible then after making a decision I don't look back and never read anything more until the next go-round. Since my wife's 2.5 year old audiovox cdm9500 from verizon is about dead (she has to pull the battery out to reboot to get it to work half the time now) she is bugging me to get something new.After popping by the Cingular and T-Mobile corporate stores I discovered that 5 minutes on their corporate web sites and howardforums gave me more knowledge than the average store clerk in those stores [good God though, some of those howardforums guys scare me. They're just phones not objects of love and obsession] The T-mobile corporate store experience was especially horrifying. Since I frequently travel to Alaska on business I asked whether there were roaming charges for Alaska. He futzed with his computer for a while until finally I walked around the counter to find him searching for Alaska through some international roaming page. No, Alaska is not between Afganistan and Algeria. What do they teach in schools these days? Anyway, he finally found Alaska on the map after I gave him an Anchorage address to type in and we discovered that all the cities were covered with green checked zones on the map indicating USA roaming coverage. So he tells me that yes I can get roaming service but he can't tell me the charge because that is determined by the roaming partner. Of course once home I discovered that all roaming within the US is free with T-mobile just like with Cingular. Idiot. So tell me again WHY I'm supposed to pay a hefty price premium to get this phone locally vs online for free? I wasted 1/2 hour in the store only to get information that was 100% wrong.I can maybe forgive ignorance at Best Buy where the clerks have to juggle 3 or 4 cell carriers plus work other departments. But to have a job in a corporate T-Mobile store and be utterly clueless about basic plan features and be unable to find the answers? Don't even get me started on their knowledge of their phone lineup. They guy didn't even know that the Nokia on display was a plastic model and not the real thing.Anyway, despite the horrifying experience at the T-mobile store (Cingular wasn't much better) I decided to give T-Mobile a try. We've been happy with Verizon but even after having been Verizon customers for 3 years and never getting a new phone they want us to renew for 2 years just to get $100 off a new phone. I can get a new T-mobile 700 minute family plan for $10/mo cheaper than Verizon or Cingular and two new Nokia 6101 phones for free with only a 1-year contract. And T-mobile will unlock the phones after 3 months so we can use them in Chile. Even if we end up hating T-mobile I can switch to a new carrier in a year or less and we'll still have the unlocked Nokia phones for travel to Chile. Heck, I would still come out even switching back to Verizon or Cingular in 9 months if we hate T-Mobile and just running both contracts concurrently for three months. The price savings is that much over renewing with Verizon now ($120 savings on the rate plan plus $100 savings on the phones = $220 which is 3 months of T-mobile service with all the fees included).Now we'll see how the experience goes ordering phones online with letstalk.com or wirefly.com as amazon won't let me do it with my zip code."

The unlock code is tied to each phones unique IMEI number and the Carrier code (Cingular Orange). From the phone,Press Green Dial key.Press *#*#dial the 8-digit code they give you.Press the center D pad buttonPress the Green Dial key. You should receive confirmation of the unlock. Then try some pre-paid GSM SIM. It should work. It did in our case. Granted their first six answers will be \"NO.\" But unless you are the type of person that can't or won't haggle the price on anything, I can see why you might not be able to get an unlock code. But most anyone else should be able to do it. Aaron"

            "text": "Buying cellphones online vs locally. Comments?:Hi guys. The two year contracts on my wife and my verizon phones have expired so we are free too look elsewhere. I was contemplating going with Cingular and getting the Nokia 6102 or Motorola V551 or RAZr. At this point I'm leaning to the Nokia for battery life and signal strength. I'm also looking at the Cingular Nation 700 minute family plan. These are the different prices I've found:Letstalk.complan w/2 year contract: 60.00/moNokia 6102: free (instant rebate)v550: free (instant rebate)RAZr: free (instant rebate)Wirefly.complan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: free w/180 day rebatev550: free w/180 day rebateRAZr: free w/180 day rebateverizon.complan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: $89v550: $99RAZr: $199Verizon local storeplan w/2 year contract: 69.99/moNokia 6102: $89v550: $99RAZr: $199Am I missing something here? I read as much of the fine print as possible and it appears that the LetsTalk.com $60/mo contract for the Family Talk Nation 700 plan is identical in every way to the $69.99 Family Talk Nation 700 plan offered by Cingular and Wirefly. In addition, I get the instant rebate from letstalk.com rather than having to wait 180 days with wirefly and no rebate at all from Cingular online or B&M stores.I also assume that all of the taxes and fees that are percentage-based will be lower on a $60 plan rather than a $69.99 plan so I may save slightly more than $10/mo.Is there something I'm missing here? Some catch or fine print that I'm unaware of? If not, what reason is there for paying an extra $200 for the phones and an extra $10/mo to get the phone locally?",

But yea, performance-wise, the 800 is the same. The N810 lacks FM radio, by the wayThe N800 is so ridiculously well-priced. I had the $ to spend on the 810, but if it wasn't for my obsession with the keyboard (the touchscreen keyboard is good btw) I'd have gone with the N800 and been able to afford tons of storage and an external GPS to link with BT.By the way, Dell had the N810 for $375 including shipping. I'm not sure if that deal is still up."

With that I get net access to sync up with my left at home laptop, a multimedia player that will even streams from my lappy. BT keyboard and it all fits into my jacket pocket without weighing me down.The extras, a new os to learn, and all those programs fill this out. And with the palm emulation I will be able to run datebook5 or even upgrade and that makes this the best PDA ever. Funny how the word is that PDAs are dead yet the first thing that everyone screams for is a good PIM!Unfortunately, my n800 had some malfunction that would not let it flash the new os. I had to send it away and it’s only been 2 weeks. Figure if I get it back before February I’ll have something going on.My only troubles with the n800 was more around Nokia and the repositories. They are so slow. Even before the os08 upgrade the connections and download speeds were iffy. The people that are working to keep them going and the gurus on the many forums are kind and helpful. I am looking forward to working with them. Thinking of getting some for my young niece nephews."
