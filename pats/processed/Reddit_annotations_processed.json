                    "text": "Picked up P7P yesterday after having my P6P.:I don't have any issues 6Pro I just need to get new gadgets constantly. I think I may have a problem with amount of money I spend...LoL. anyways.... I figure basesd on the rumours of the Pixel 8 that I'm reading, Google appears tonig down the \"new tech\" I mean there's plans for a slighter lower resolution, and smaller display. I'm a fan of curved glass on phones and apparently google is going the route of the standard 8 and subsequent 8a with a flat panel. I'm sure that will please a lot customers also. My point is that I feel that (not only) Google and the smartphone industry as a whole is reaching the end of the line in terms of the capabilities and features that are possible and the Tensor 2 is light years ahead of the first gen Tensor chip but how much more can you improve the follow up to a first generation of anything?! Right? How so anyhow I am from Ontario Canada and Freedom Mobile is provider and they just launched a 40 GB/unlimited US calling and texting and instead of giving customers a single gig of US data my 40GB comes with me if I cross the border. All for just 50 bucks. So I jumped on that like a fat kid on a Smartie and compulsively left with the 7 Pro. I'm using it as I type this. What a step up from my 6 Pro. Like I stated, first generation anything's should be purchased with some degree of caution and expectations for bugs and failures of QC issues etc... None of which I experienced with my 6Pro. But!.... The improvement in the New Generation processor is undeniably amazing. While it keeps the same Titan 2 security chip which if maintained by Google's amazing monthly security updates for Pixel devices it's bullet proof anyways. I just wish we as Canadians got the same storage options. Sadly we're conifned to the 128GB non-expandable internal storage option. I wish I had a choice of the 256GB and I wish they made a 512GB variant as well. Motorola has it nailed. The new 2023 Edge+ (Remeber, I'm in Canada) has 512 GB of non-expandable \"who cares I gotta half a terabyte yo!\" LoL The canera, amazing. The polished aluminum camera module hpusing, beautiful. The speeds and such, blazing fast. So I'm not sure what other direction OEMS are going to have in the tech feature section and the processor speeds. I mean the Tensor 2 doesn't blow any Qualcomm Snapdragon's outta the water not does it eat any Samsung Kyr.... Whatever the spelling and pronunciation is of the chip. But what it is great at is being successfully fast at EVERYTHING that Geekbench or whatever can test. Unlike the previously mentioned processors that excel in one are and flip flop in others or just don't meaure up in other tests. Again, like the Tensor 1. The 2 is better at being just good at everything. Anyone who feels the same way? Or did I waste $1200.00 on something I shouldn't have. I'm a huge Pixel fan. I have the a-buds, the pro buds, the pixel watch, and the I even paid for the (surprisingly feature packed) Pixel stand Gen 2 wireless charger. I mean the thing has a micro cooling fan built in and it's designed with a very shallow curve in the bach portion or the upright position to allow that cooler air to flow right the back of my phone like a breeze up a sexy lady's sundress in August. ☺️"

            "text": "I don't have any issues 6Pro I just need to get new gadgets constantly. I think I may have a problem with amount of money I spend...LoL. anyways.... I figure basesd on the rumours of the Pixel 8 that I'm reading, Google appears tonig down the \"new tech\" I mean there's plans for a slighter lower resolution, and smaller display.I'm a fan of curved glass on phones and apparently google is going the route of the standard 8 and subsequent 8a with a flat panel. I'm sure that will please a lot customers also. My point is that I feel that (not only) Google and the smartphone industry as a whole is reaching the end of the line in terms of the capabilities and features that are possible and the Tensor 2 is light years ahead of the first gen Tensor chip but how much more can you improve the follow up to a first generation of anything?! Right? How so anyhow I am from Ontario Canada and Freedom Mobile is provider and they just launched a 40 GB/unlimited US calling and texting and instead of giving customers a single gig of US data my 40GB comes with me if I cross the border. All for just 50 bucks. So I jumped on that like a fat kid on a Smartie and compulsively left with the 7 Pro. I'm using it as I type this. What a step up from my 6 Pro. Like I stated, first generation anything's should be purchased with some degree of caution and expectations for bugs and failures of QC issues etc... None of which I experienced with my 6Pro. But!.... The improvement in the New Generation processor is undeniably amazing. While it keeps the same Titan 2 security chip which if maintained by Google's amazing monthly security updates for Pixel devices it's bullet proof anyways. I just wish we as Canadians got the same storage options. Sadly we're conifned to the 128GB non-expandable internal storage option. I wish I had a choice of the 256GB and I wish they made a 512GB variant as well. Motorola has it nailed. The new 2023 Edge+ (Remeber, I'm in Canada) has 512 GB of non-expandable \"who cares I gotta half a terabyte yo!\" LoL The canera, amazing. The polished aluminum camera module hpusing, beautiful. The speeds and such, blazing fast. So I'm not sure what other direction OEMS are going to have in the tech feature section and the processor speeds. I mean the Tensor 2 doesn't blow any Qualcomm Snapdragon's outta the water not does it eat any Samsung Kyr.... Whatever the spelling and pronunciation is of the chip. But what it is great at is being successfully fast at EVERYTHING that Geekbench or whatever can test. Unlike the previously mentioned processors that excel in one are and flip flop in others or just don't meaure up in other tests. Again, like the Tensor 1. The 2 is better at being just good at everything. Anyone who feels the same way? Or did I waste $1200.00 on something I shouldn't have. I'm a huge Pixel fan. I have the a-buds, the pro buds, the pixel watch, and the I even paid for the (surprisingly feature packed) Pixel stand Gen 2 wireless charger. I mean the thing has a micro cooling fan built in and it's designed with a very shallow curve in the bach portion or the upright position to allow that cooler air to flow right the back of my phone like a breeze up a sexy lady's sundress in August. ☺️",

Their trade in option estimates that I can get \"up to $150\" for trade in of a Pixel 3. That seems wild to me, given how much a refurbished Pixel 3 sells for. What is everyone else's experience with trading in older model phones? Do you actually get anywhere close to the \"estimate\" price, or is that like when stores say \"sales up to 70% off!\" but 99% of the stuff on sale is only like 1% off? Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, definitely making me more confident about using the feature!"

The Trade-in tool quoted $267.50 for the Pixel 4. The Trade-in Kit came within a few days and I sent my Pixel 4 back to Google. Within a month of purchasing my Pixel 6a the Trade-in refund was processed for $290.00. So I was pleasantly surprised considering I've heard some horror stories here on reddit."

Their trade in option estimates that I can get \"up to $150\" for trade in of a Pixel 3. That seems wild to me, given how much a refurbished Pixel 3 sells for. What is everyone else's experience with trading in older model phones? Do you actually get anywhere close to the \"estimate\" price, or is that like when stores say \"sales up to 70% off!\" but 99% of the stuff on sale is only like 1% off? Edit: Thanks for the replies everyone, definitely making me more confident about using the feature!",

Every time I take a photo with the front camera, it looks good for a second - then it is processed and it looks like garbage, too dark, blurry, oversatured etc. I compared it with the photos I took with my old phone (an iPhone XR) and they were much, much, much better. I have tried using the RAW setting, tried Top Shot and picking, etc. doesn't help at all. Any ideas on a fix? Honestly this is a dealbreaker for me which sucks, the rest of the phone is great. I can't return it and will probably lose hundreds on the resale market even though its brand new. Really disappointed because the person who sold it to me said the camera (front and back) was best on the market. Guess you should never trust Telstra."

Every time I take a photo with the front camera, it looks good for a second - then it is processed and it looks like garbage, too dark, blurry, oversatured etc. I compared it with the photos I took with my old phone (an iPhone XR) and they were much, much, much better. I have tried using the RAW setting, tried Top Shot and picking, etc. doesn't help at all. Any ideas on a fix? Honestly this is a dealbreaker for me which sucks, the rest of the phone is great. I can't return it and will probably lose hundreds on the resale market even though its brand new. Really disappointed because the person who sold it to me said the camera (front and back) was best on the market. Guess you should never trust Telstra.",

On my pixel 5 I had workspaces setup which was perfect for my work account, but for some reason I just can't figure out how to do it on the Pixel 7 pro with Android 13. &#x200B; If I go to **Settings > Passwords and Accounts > Add an account** it does let me add my work account, but it just becomes an option I can use to log in to a single app. Rather I need to have 2 calendars, 2 emails, 2 google sheets, and such. I need the separation that lets you install the same app twice but in a different workspace. Has anyone figured this out? From online reading it should work automatically when I add my work's google based account, but no dice. Edit: It looks like something changed at my work with our enterprise account. So this is not about the phone. So no issue here. &#x200B;"

As these are the majority of use cases, the Pixel Tablet makes more sense for me. If you are looking for a tablet optimized app ecosystem, IPad Air may be a better choice."

Also this is a tablet with home features, and not get confused to them marketing it has a google nest hub alternative. It isnt. Plus there are no good cases out yet that work with the dock. Part of the price IS the dock so putting a case on that isn't compatible with it, well your just overpayed for a pixel tablet. I have a kid, so I need a full case that stays on, and not a magnet case like speck I draw so I needed the Air. If you have an iphone it just makes sense to get an ipad. The way your phone and tablet will sync together is something your going to like. If you ever tried an android device, the pixel tablet is just one big android phone"

I'm no audiophile though, I'm sure there are better options out there. I wear them and sweat every day at work and so far no issues with moisture. Overall expensive but easy to recommend if you're looking in that price range."

I weekend warriored too hard and irritated the nerves in my wrist/elbow. I had to start taking it off at night because it added to the pain/irritation. I recently started training for a race and switched to my Garmin Fenix 5s. To my surprise, no pain or irritation at night. It made a huge difference. Wearing them both on a bike ride today, the Pixel feels so much more heavier/bulkier although the Garmin is around double the weight. Thoughts? I'm wondering, is it the design of the case/ergonomics? Better weight distribution on the Garmin?"

I had to start taking it off at night because it added to the pain/irritation. I recently started training for a race and switched to my Garmin Fenix 5s. To my surprise, no pain or irritation at night. It made a huge difference. Wearing them both on a bike ride today, the Pixel feels so much more heavier/bulkier although the Garmin is around double the weight. Thoughts? I'm wondering, is it the design of the case/ergonomics? Better weight distribution on the Garmin?",

What I'm wondering is, does it have machine learning AI\\* built in? For example when I step outside and it whacks the brightness up to 94%, if I lower it down to 80% each time, is it going to learn than I prefer 80% brightness for outside and start adapting to 80% instead of 94%? \\[\\*EDIT: When I say AI, I mean a system that learns my choices and adjusts future brightness accordingly, not an actual AI\\] Thanks."

            "text": "I used to hate Adaptive Brightness on the Pixel 6 (Android 13) because of how extreme its choices seem to be (whamming brightness up to 100% if I move to a slightly brighter room, steadily decreasing brightness while I try to read something indistinct etc...) however I am sick of having an as-good-as black screen when out in daylight without manually adjusting it (particularly when it's hard to see the controls), so I am giving Adaptive Brightness another go. What I'm wondering is, does it have machine learning AI\\* built in? For example when I step outside and it whacks the brightness up to 94%, if I lower it down to 80% each time, is it going to learn than I prefer 80% brightness for outside and start adapting to 80% instead of 94%? \\[\\*EDIT: When I say AI, I mean a system that learns my choices and adjusts future brightness accordingly, not an actual AI\\] Thanks.",

I recently upgraded from my Pixel 5 to 7 Pro, also purchasing the Gen II Pixel Wireless Charging Stand to go with it. Now, I've been using a Magnetic car mount that clips into the air vent, along witha magnetic adhesive plate that attached to the back of the phone. I'm now discovering that that plate prevents the Stand from charging the phone. I've tried using a smaller plate and changing it's location on the phone with limited success. Does anyone have any recommendations for how i could use both? I've heard that Apple has a certain kind of magnet that lets people use both, is there something that exists like that for Google? Or a magnetic case that allows both to work? Thanks in advance!"

Now, I've been using a Magnetic car mount that clips into the air vent, along witha magnetic adhesive plate that attached to the back of the phone. I'm now discovering that that plate prevents the Stand from charging the phone. I've tried using a smaller plate and changing it's location on the phone with limited success. Does anyone have any recommendations for how i could use both? I've heard that Apple has a certain kind of magnet that lets people use both, is there something that exists like that for Google? Or a magnetic case that allows both to work? Thanks in advance!",

Pixel3 or Car USB Port?:Last week, my Pixel3 (Google sent a refurbished P3 11 months ago) was connected to my 2021 Sonata USB charge (not data) port, while I was driving. When I arrived at destination, I found both the P3 and this particular car USB port stopped working. (Both phone and charge port were working at the beginning of drive. To troubleshoot, I tried different cable/phone/car data port and can confirm only Pixel3 and the car USB charge port are bad.)

I was using it for Android Auto (plugged directly into my car's USB port that's meant for that) but after I unplugged it and went into work as usual, I found that my phone was bricked. Wouldn't turn on, wouldn't turn off, wouldn't charge... Even when I plugged it into my laptop for troubleshooting, it would only come up as something like \"snapdragon device\" instead of \"pixel 4xl\", like my Pixel 6a comes up as \"pixel 6a\" in File Explorer & Device Manager when I plug it in. A *long* story short: I finally got it replaced with a refurbished Pixel 4XL (they claimed they had \"run out\" of stock of new ones), only after fighting with Google support that it was indeed still within warranty because Google previously gave out a free 1 year extended warranty to Pixel 4 XL's for (you guessed it) [power issues]( Edited quickly after posting to add: I'm not sure what happened to mine either, but I can give you what my best guess was for what happened to mine...Basically, my phone would do a routine system backup to my Google One account whenever it was plugged in to charge. So if it was backing up that morning (or updating, I suppose?), suddenly turning my car off (or my unplugging it) would've caused the phone to lose the power it was using to charge, thus interrupting the backup process and may have bricked the system. 🤷‍♀️"

The Pixel 6a is a bigger phone despite the same screen size, thanks to thicker bezels and having a chin. 146.3 x 70.9 x 7.6 mm - S23 152.2 x 71.8 x 8.9 mm - 6A As you can see the Pixel is bigger in all dimensions, but most importantly the thickness. 7.6mm vs 8.9mm is a huge difference speaking in terms of phones. But the difference becomes more staggering when you compute the volumes of the two phones: 78,670 mm³ - S23 97,131 mm³ - 6A The Pixel 6A has ~ 25% more volume than S23! Sure the S23 has heavier parts like the glass back and the telephoto camera, but a sheer 25% volume difference is something that even those cannot negate. And what did Google do with all that extra volume? They put a bigger battery and more cooling it seems."

Yes, before people jump to the comments, I have now disabled 5G, and it was while roaming, so I definitely left myself wide open on that front. What I would ideally like would be a phone with a comparable smoothness in performance, vaguely similar screen size (it can be a bit smaller, I'm not too fussy), and much better battery life. I'm totally willing to cut corners on the camera to make that happen. I'm posting this to see why other folks have upgraded from their Pixel 6s, and why, to see if my usage and expectation line up with others!"

Yes, before people jump to the comments, I have now disabled 5G, and it was while roaming, so I definitely left myself wide open on that front. What I would ideally like would be a phone with a comparable smoothness in performance, vaguely similar screen size (it can be a bit smaller, I'm not too fussy), and much better battery life. I'm totally willing to cut corners on the camera to make that happen. I'm posting this to see why other folks have upgraded from their Pixel 6s, and why, to see if my usage and expectation line up with others!",

I recently purchased the Pixel 7 with high hopes for its camera, considering all the praise it has received. However, to my disappointment, I found the camera quality to be quite mediocre. In fact, when I compared the selfies captured by the Pixel 7 with my 4-year-old Samsung M31 entry-level phone, the results were shocking. The selfies taken by the Pixel 7 turned out to be dull and very dark, unlike the vibrant and well-lit selfies from the Samsung M31. Even worse, the night mode on the Pixel 7 performed poorly, making the selfies even more dull. It's disheartening to see a flagship device struggle in low-light conditions when an older, entry-level phone outperforms it. I wanted to reach out to the community to see if anyone else has encountered this issue with the Pixel 7's camera. Are there any specific settings or adjustments that could potentially enhance the camera performance? Or is this a known limitation of the device that I should have considered before purchasing?"

That itself is more average, most likely due to needing to be compact so the pinhole camera isn't too noticeable. In terms of raw specs combined with Samsung boosting saturation in their photos, it's probably why it looks better on the M31. Personally I prefer the more natural colours on the Pixel but it's all down to personal preferences."

Nothing wrong with that, but it does mean you should have done some research to check how the photos will come out of the phones you were considering."

I recently purchased the Pixel 7 with high hopes for its camera, considering all the praise it has received. However, to my disappointment, I found the camera quality to be quite mediocre. In fact, when I compared the selfies captured by the Pixel 7 with my 4-year-old Samsung M31 entry-level phone, the results were shocking. The selfies taken by the Pixel 7 turned out to be dull and very dark, unlike the vibrant and well-lit selfies from the Samsung M31. Even worse, the night mode on the Pixel 7 performed poorly, making the selfies even more dull. It's disheartening to see a flagship device struggle in low-light conditions when an older, entry-level phone outperforms it. I wanted to reach out to the community to see if anyone else has encountered this issue with the Pixel 7's camera. Are there any specific settings or adjustments that could potentially enhance the camera performance? Or is this a known limitation of the device that I should have considered before purchasing?",

It's been too long to remember specifically but some truly awful bugs. I found a thread here where someone was saying not to transfer or any of that stuff. Complete blank slate, link your Google account, and then you can easily enough manually copy over your settings. I just kept them side by side took 2 seconds. Anyways, doing it this way got rid of all those issues."

Of course, this doesn't work for day to day use so I bought a P7P and did the cable transfer to back everything up but it doesn't appear that it's transferring my home screen settings over. I remember when I got my P6P it did just that from another Pixel, does the P7P no longer do this?",
